# CSC 370: Database Systems

## Course Overview
This course provides an overview of a relational database management system (RDBMS), from modelling the world and designing a database to querying the data and optimising performance in a manner that maintains the critical ACID properties of a database. The course will include elements of software engineering, theoretical computer science, programming, and computer systems.

## Topics
The course will consist of four modules, which each depend on the prior module. The list of modules and associated topics include:

    1. Logical Database Design with the Relational Data Model
        • The Relational Data Model
        • Basic Relational Algebra
        • Data Dependencies and Constraints
        • Normalisation
    2. Conceptual Database Design with the Entity-Relationship Model
        • Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD's)
        • Principles of good design
        • Mapping between ERD's and the relational data model
    3. Interacting with relational databases
        • Mathematically expressing the logic of complex queries (using a logic-based programming language called Datalog)
        • Writing queries in SQL (the de-facto standard declarative language for relational databases) to create databases, manipulate content, and perform data analysis
        • ACID properties, including transactions and isolation levels to support concurrency
        • Interfacing with relational databases using connectors like JDBC [optional content subject to the course's pace]
    4. Query Processing & Storage
        • The I/O Computational Model
        • Algorithms and data structures for efficiently computing query results
        • Physical and logical query plans expressed with relational algebra parse trees
        • Query cost estimation and query plan optimisation
        • Recovery, logging, redundancy, and resilience
        
## Course Objectives And Learning Outcomes
The objective of the course is to introduce database management systems (DBMS) and the theory behind their design and use. There will be an emphasis on how to organize, maintain and retrieve--efficiently, and effectively--information from a DBMS. The course will have four main areas of focus:

    • Database design: how can we describe the world in terms of data?
    • Data analysis: how can we answer questions about the world in terms of questions on such data?
    • Concurrency and robustness: how does the database management system (DBMS) allow multiple users to query and modify the same data? What happens when there is a system failure?
    • Efficiency and scalability: how does the DBMS store large amounts of data and process them efficiently?
